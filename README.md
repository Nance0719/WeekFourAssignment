# Car Enthusiast Quiz
## Description

To create a car quiz where when the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and the user is presented with a question
and after they answer the question they are presented with another question. If the question is answered incorrectly
then time is subtracted from the clock. When the user answers all the questions or the timer reaches zero, the game is over.
Once the game is over, the user can save their initials and score.
